# Release of Places365-CNNs
We release various convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on Places365 to the public. Places365 is the latest subset of [Places2 Database](http://places2.csail.mit.edu). There are two versions of Places365: **Places365-Standard** and **Places365-Challenge**. The train set of Places365-Standard has ~1.8 million images from 365 scene categories, where there are at most 5000 images per category. We have trained various baseline CNNs on the Places365-Standard and released them as below. Meanwhile, the train set of Places365-Challenge has extra 6.2 million images along with all the images of Places365-Standard (so totally ~8 million images), where there are at most 40,000 images per category. Places365-Challenge will be used for the Places2 Challenge 2016 to be held in conjunction with the [ILSVRC](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/) and [COCO](http://mscoco.org/dataset/#overview) joint workshop at [ECCV 2016](http://www.eccv2016.org/). 

The data Places365-Standard and Places365-Challenge are released at [Places2 website](http://places2.csail.mit.edu).

* ResNet152-hybrid1365: [deploy](deploy_resnet152_hybrid1365.prototxt) [weights](http://places2.csail.mit.edu/models_places365/resnet152_hybrid1365.caffemodel)
* ResNet152-places365 trained from scratch using Torch: [torch model](http://places2.csail.mit.edu/models_places365/resnet152_places365.t7) converted caffemodel:[deploy](http://netdissect.csail.mit.edu/dissect/zoo/resnet-152-torch-places365.prototxt) [weights](http://netdissect.csail.mit.edu/dissect/zoo/resnet-152-torch-places365.caffemodel). It is the original ResNet with 152 layers. On the validation set, the top1 error is 45.26% and the top5 error is 15.02%.
* ResNet50-places365 trained from scratch using Torch: [torch model](http://places2.csail.mit.edu/models_places365/resnet50_places365.t7). It is Preact ResNet with 50 layers. The top1 error is 44.82% and the top5 error is 14.71%.
* To use the alexnet and vgg16 caffemodels in Torch, use the torch library [loadcaffe](https://github.com/szagoruyko/loadcaffe), where you could simply load the caffe model use the following commands. But note that the input image scale should be from 0-255, which is different to the 0-1 scale in the previous resnet Torch models trained from scratch in [fb.resnet.torch](https://github.com/facebook/fb.resnet.torch).
```
	require 'loadcaffe'
	model = loadcaffe.load('deploy_alexnet_places365.prototxt', 'alexnet_places365.caffemodel', 'cudnn')
```
* PyTorch Places365 models: [AlexNet](http://places2.csail.mit.edu/models_places365/whole_alexnet_places365_python36.pth.tar), [ResNet18](http://places2.csail.mit.edu/models_places365/whole_resnet18_places365_python36.pth.tar), [ResNet50](http://places2.csail.mit.edu/models_places365/whole_resnet50_places365_python36.pth.tar), [DenseNet161](http://places2.csail.mit.edu/models_places365/whole_densenet161_places365_python36.pth.tar). The models are trained in Python2.7+PyTorch 0.2, then migrated to python36 using [this script](convert_python36.py), see [this issue](https://github.com/CSAILVision/places365/issues/25). **You don't need to untar the pytorch model files, refer to the following placesCNN demo code to see how to load the model**. Run [basic code](run_placesCNN_basic.py) to get the scene prediction from PlacesCNN:
```
    python run_placesCNN_basic.py

    RESULT ON http://places.csail.mit.edu/demo/12.jpg
    0.519 -> patio
    0.394 -> restaurant_patio
    0.018 -> beer_garden
    0.017 -> diner/outdoor
    0.016 -> courtyard
```
or run [unified code](run_placesCNN_unified.py) to predict scene categories, indoor/outdoor type, [scene attributes](https://cs.brown.edu/~gen/sunattributes.html), and the [class activation map](http://cnnlocalization.csail.mit.edu/) together from PlacesCNN:
```
    python run_placesCNN_unified.py

    RESULT ON http://places.csail.mit.edu/demo/6.jpg
    --TYPE: indoor
    --SCENE CATEGORIES:
    0.690 -> food_court
    0.163 -> cafeteria
    0.033 -> dining_hall
    0.022 -> fastfood_restaurant
    0.016 -> restaurant
    --SCENE ATTRIBUTES:
    no horizon, enclosed area, man-made, socializing, indoor lighting, cloth, congregating, eating, working
    Class activation map is output as cam.jpg
```

* Train PlacesCNN using Pytorch. The training script is at [here](train_placesCNN.py). Download the Places365 standard easyformat split at [here](http://data.csail.mit.edu/places/places365/places365standard_easyformat.tar). Untar it to some folder. Then run the following:
```
    python train_placesCNN.py -a resnet18 /xxx/yyy/places365standard_easyformat
```

The category index file is [the file](categories_places365.txt). Here we combine the training set of ImageNet 1.2 million data with Places365-Standard to train VGG16-hybrid1365 model, its category index file is [the file](categories_hybrid1365.txt). The indoor and outdoor labels for the categories is in [the file](IO_places365.txt). The scene hierarchy is listed at [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H7ADoEIGgbF_eXh9kcJjCs5j_r3VJwke4nebhkdzksg/edit?usp=sharing), with a simple browswer at [here](http://places2.csail.mit.edu/scene_hierarchy.html).

### Performance of the Places365-CNNs
The performance of the baseline CNNs is listed below. ResidualNet's performance will be updated soon. We use the class score averaged over 10-crops of each testing image to classify. Here we also fine-tune the resNet152 on Places365-standard, for 10 crop average it has 85.08% on the validation set and 85.07% on the test set for top-5 accuracy.

As comparison, we list the performance of the baseline CNNs trained on [Places205](http://places.csail.mit.edu/downloadCNN.html) as below. There are 160 more scene categories in Places365 than the Places205, the top-5 accuracy doesn't drop much.

The performance of the deep features of Places365-CNNs as generic visual features is listed below ResidualNets' performances will be included soon. The setup for each experiment is the same as the ones in our [NIPS'14 paper](http://places.csail.mit.edu/places_NIPS14.pdf)
